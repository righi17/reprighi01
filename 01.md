### Project 1: E-commerce Funnel Optimization Dashboard
**Situation:** An online retailer was experiencing a high cart abandonment rate but lacked visibility into where exactly in the checkout process users were dropping off.

**Process:**
1.  **Measurement Plan:** Designed and implemented a detailed GA4 event tracking schema using Google Tag Manager, including `view_item_list`, `select_item`, `add_to_cart`, and every step of the checkout funnel.
2.  **Data Integration:** Exported raw GA4 event data to Google BigQuery for advanced segmentation and analysis that isn't possible in the standard GA4 UI.
3.  **Visualization:** Developed an interactive Looker Studio dashboard that visualized the complete conversion funnel, allowing stakeholders to filter by traffic source, device category, and user demographics.
4.  **Insight Generation:** The analysis revealed a significant drop-off on the shipping information page, specifically for mobile users.

**Result:** By streamlining the mobile checkout form based on these insights, the company achieved a **15% decrease in cart abandonment** and a **10% uplift in overall conversion rate** within two months.
